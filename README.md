# Stress Calendar 
StressCalendar is a desktop application that displays a calendar that lets users input their daily mood, notes, and amount of physical activity for each day. The program is written using QT Quick and uses QML to display the UI and Javascript to interface with an SQLite database and perform back-end logic.
